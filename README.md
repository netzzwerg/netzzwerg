<h1 align="center">Servus ðŸ‘‹, I'm BÃ©la Varga</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate frontend developer from Munich, Germany.</h3>


I have been working as a developer for more than 15 years. During this time, I have used various languages and technologies (`Lua`, `Perl`, `PHP`, `C#`, `Java`, `ActionScript`, `JavaScript`). I have always been a visual person and try to produce visual results with my work whenever I can. So I quickly came to the decision that the combination of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` is the toolbox of my choice.


I strongly believe in the openness of the Internet and JavaScript which led me to support that cause in my private life as well: I founded **MunichJS â€“ a JavaScript user group**, worked as an editor for **MAG.js â€“ the first German JavaScript magazine** and currently organizing the **JS Kongress â€“ community-driven JavaScript Conference in Munich**
